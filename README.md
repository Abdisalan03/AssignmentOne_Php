1. Write a program that compares three integer numbers then specifies and prints the greatest and
the smallest one (do not use built-in function such as min or max).
2. Write a program that prints whether the number is even (divisible by 2) or odd.
3. Write a program that prints numbers divisible by 5 from 1 to 50 using while statement.
4. Write a program to find the reverse of a given number (for example, the reverse of 12345 = 54321,
do not use any built-in function such as the strrev built-in function) using do…while statement.
5. Write a program to find common factors of two positive integer numbers (for example, common
factors of 42 and 70 are: 2, 7 and 14) using for statement.
6. Write a program that calculates highest common factor (HCF) of two integer numbers (if any) (for
example, HCF of 18 and 24 = 6) using do…while statement.
7. Write a program that prints whether the number is a prime (whole number greater than 1 which is
exactly divisible by itself and 1 but no other number) or non-prime using for statement.
8. Write a program that prints non-prime numbers from 90 to 12 using while and for statement.
9. Write a program that prints Fibonacci series, a series of numbers in which each number is the sum
of the two preceding numbers. For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc using while
statement.
